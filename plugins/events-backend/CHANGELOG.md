### Minor Changes

- dc9da28abd: Support events received via HTTP endpoints at plugin-events-backend.

  The plugin provides an event publisher `HttpPostIngressEventPublisher`
  which will allow you to receive events via
  HTTP endpoints `POST /api/events/http/{topic}`
  and will publish these to the used event broker.

  Using a provided custom validator, you can participate in the decision
  which events are accepted, e.g. by verifying the source of the request.

  Please find more information at
  https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/events-backend/README.md.

- 7bbd2403a1: Adds a new backend plugin plugin-events-backend for managing events.

  plugin-events-node exposes interfaces which can be used by modules.

  plugin-events-backend-test-utils provides utilities which can be used while writing tests e.g. for modules.
